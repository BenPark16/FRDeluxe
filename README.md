Battle Tree Damage Calculator
=======================

This is forked from turskain's calculator for in-game battle facility (Battle Tree, Battle Maison, etc) (https://github.com/turskain/turskain.github.io), which itself is forked from
http://pokemonshowdown.com/damagecalc/.

The changes made were mostly adaptations from Trainer Tower's damage calculator (https://trainertower.com/damagecalc/) made by Jake White, and cant say's/LegoFigure11's damage calculator based off of it (https://cantsay.github.io). 

Repo for this fork:
